RIFT PARSER

This is a command-line parser for RIFT written in Scala.

If you aren't familiar with running tools from the command line, then
don't bother. (I might make it easier in the future.)

Pre-requisites:

 - Install Java, if you don't have it. (You should.)

 - Install Scala from: http://www.scala-lang.org/downloads

Installation:

 - Download the repository.

 - Put in its own folder somewhere

   - Location doesn't matter, but it assumes by default that RIFT is
     installed at "../../RIFT Game".

 - (Optionally) Edit "./parser/parse.sh" so that "RIFT_HOME = .."
   points to the path of the main RIFT folder. See Option A below.

Running:

There are two options for running the parser. Both boil down to the
same thing; the first is easier but less configurable, and only works
in a UNIX-like environment. The second is more general and should work
anywhere.

 - Open a terminal and navigate to the parser directory.

  Option A:

 - Run parse.sh from a UNIX shell.

  Option B:

 - Run: fsc *.scala

   - If this produces error messages, then please send me an email.

 - Run: scala Simple <RIFT Combat Log>

   - <RIFT Combat Log> should be the path of "CombatLog.txt" in the
     RIFT installation folder.

Configuration:

If you are a coder type then it should be fairly easy to change the
behavior of the parser. I plan on improving this next, because right
now it is pretty inflexible and the configuration isn't in a single
place. Important pieces are contained in...

 - Config.scala: A few useful flags, such as onlyPlayers and
   combinePets.

 - Simple.scala: Top-level formatting for printing to console and
   copying to clipboard. Can also print out individual actions as they
   are parsed, but this will be stupidly slow.

 - Combat.scala: Format of DPS and HPS lists. (See "format")

 - Entity.scala: Format of individual DPS, HPS entries and player
   names. (See "format")
