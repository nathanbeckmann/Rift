                                 RIFT

This repository contains a few tools I developed while playing the
game Rift. Each lives in its own subdirectory.

parser: A simple, command-line parser for Rift.

data: Stores intermediate files to generate graphs, and graphs
themselves.

graphs: Mathematica scripts to generate graphs from info spit out by
parser.
