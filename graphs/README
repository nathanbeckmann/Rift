                                Graphs

This directory contains Mathematica scripts to generate graphs. To use
the script, the basic command is:

math <data file> < Graphs.m

Where 'math' is the command-line Mathematica utility (tested on 7.0
and 8.0), <data file> is the data file generated by the parser (see
./parser/README), and Graphs.m is the script in this directory.

 - Start.m: Reads in the data file passed on the command line.

 - Lib.m: Contains all of the meat to parse data, process it, and
   generate graphs. See the later functions in this file if you want
   to tweak the behavior. You can also change plotOpts and
   plotOptsStacks to tweak the graphs.

 - Graphs.m: Calls into Lib.m to generate damage and healing graphs.
